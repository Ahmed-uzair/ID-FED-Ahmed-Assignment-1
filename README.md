**hi**
For this project I deecided to create a dragon boat website. In this website People can look at the products such as paddles, bags, gloves, and other dragon boat accessories. They can alos add the things they want to cart. There is classes provided and if users want classes they can see the time and price from this website. If they want to book boats for their friends and family they can see the information in the website. If the users want to give feedback they can do so through the website.

If you want to buy cool looking paddles this is the website. The paddles look cool doesnt mean they wont perform, hornet paddles are the best in the market right now. The classes provided are instructed by national rowers and have been paddling for years. The price is also the lowest in the market. Our website is the only website allowing you too choose betweeen 22-men boat and 12 men boat in the lowest price.

DESIGN PROCESS

This website meant for 3 people the **beginner/recreational paddlers**, **intermediate paddlers**, **advance paddlers**

**beginner/recreational paddlers** -As a beginner paddler I want to be able to attent beginner level classes to improve my paddling. As a recreational paddler I sometimes want to attend beginner level classes and sometimes would want to book a boat for my friends and family members to try dragon boating so that we can have fun together. These are all available in the website.

**intermediate paddlers**- As a intermediate paddler I want to be able to attent intermediate level classes and sometimes would want to buy dragon boat paddles and accessories from the shop to use frequently. These are all available in the website.

**advance paddlers** - As an advance paddler i want to be able to attend advance level training and be able to buy my own paddles and accessories as i will be using the on a daily basis. Getting my own paddle and accessoires will make me sightly better at paddling. All these are available in the website.

TECHNOLOGIES USED
I used javascript for the functions of the website such as shopping cart and sort by. I used css for the UI of the website. I used html to put the contents of the website

TESTING

1.  Login page:
    i. Go to the login page
    ii. Try to login to the page without entering a username and see if it send you a message to fill up the username
    iii. Try to login to the page without entering a password and see if it send you a message to fill up the password
    iv. Try to put in a valid username and password and press login. The website should bring you to the home page of the website.

On a browser all the pages hotbar are placed horizontally in a computer but in mobile view they are placed vertically. The pictures are bigger in the in a laptop than the mobile view. The popular products in the are side by side in a computer view but in a mobile view the the products are placed below each other. The classes in a the home page have 2 class side by side in mobile view but in computer view it has many more side by side. The galler in the home page is side by side in computer view but in mobile view it is up and down. The login page in the computer is bigger than the mobile view login page. The footer for all the pages in a computer view is form left to right but in a mobile view it is up to down. In the products and classes page the contents are smaller and have 2 items side by side in the mobile view but in a computer view the contents are bigger and the there are 3 items side by side. The boat booking page for both mobile view and laptop view are the same except for the size of the contents, the mobile view is smaller than the laptop view. Lastly, the contact us page for the operating places and time there are 2 columns but in the mobile view there is only one. The rest of the contents are just smaller in the mobile view than in the computer view.
