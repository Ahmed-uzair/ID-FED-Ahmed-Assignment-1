**hi**
For this project I deecided to create a dragon boat website. In this website People can look at the products such as paddles, bags, gloves, and other dragon boat accessories. They can alos add the things they want to cart. There is classes provided and if users want classes they can see the time and price from this website. If they want to book boats for their friends and family they can see the information in the website. If the users want to give feedback they can do so through the website.

If you want to buy cool looking paddles this is the website. The paddles look cool doesnt mean they wont perform, hornet paddles are the best in the market right now. The classes provided are instructed by national rowers and have been paddling for years. The price is also the lowest in the market. Our website is the only website allowing you too choose betweeen 22-men boat and 12 men boat in the lowest price.

DESIGN PROCESS

This website meant for 3 people the **beginner/recreational paddlers**, **intermediate paddlers**, **advance paddlers**

**beginner/recreational paddlers** - For beginner paddlers this website can be used as they can attend beginner level classes. For recreational paddlers they can book a boat and paddle with their friends and families.

**intermediate paddlers**- For the intermediate paddlers they can attend intermediate classes. They can also buy paddles from the website.

**advance paddlers** - For beginner paddlers this website can be used as they can attend advance level classes. They can use the website to buy items.

 <!-- For the products and the some information in the website i took them from these 2 websites.  https://www.hornetwatersports.com/  https://www.sportshub.com.sg/sport-fitness/dragon-boat -->
